These notes are based on the Udacity course covering Exploratory Data Analysis <https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651>.

```{r}
# Get the data & manipulate columns
require(dplyr)
require(reshape2)
require(ggthemes)
require(ggmap)
```

# Load data

I compiled this data using [FAA data](https://goo.gl/9xI1eg) on Preliminary Accident and Incident 
Notices. The data can be downloaded directly into R, and transformed into the same format that 
I'll be using by running the `wrangle.R` script that I have posted to Github. I'll read in the data, 
as a RDS file, but for convince I've also provided the data as a 
[CSV file](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/FAA_Accidents/blob/master/FAA-data.csv).

```{r}
FAA <- readRDS("FAA-data.RDS")
```

Next, I'll build a map of the United States, and plot the data

```{r BUILD | Map}
# Map
US <- qmap("United States", zoom=4, maptype = "toner-lite", source = "stamen")
```


## Figure 01

```{r Fig01 | Crash Location, echo=T}
US + stat_density2d(aes(x=lon, y=lat, fill=..level.., alpha=..level..), geom="polygon", data=FAA) +
  geom_point(data=FAA, aes(x=lon, y=lat)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="yellow", high="blue") + 
  guides(alpha=F, fill=F) + theme_map() +
  labs(title="Density of Plane Crashes Reported by FAA")
```

## Figure 02

```{r Fig02 | Max Injury Geospace, echo=T}
US + geom_point(data=FAA, aes(x=lon, y=lat, shape=Craft.Damage, color=Injury.Max.Level))
```

## Figure 03

```{r Fig03 | Injuries vs Phase of Flight, echo=T}
ggplot(FAA, aes(x=Flight.Phase, y=Injury.Type)) + 
  geom_bin2d(aes(alpha=Injury.Count)) + 
  scale_fill_continuous(low="blue", high="red", name="Frequency") +
  scale_alpha_continuous(name="Count") +
  labs(title="Injuries vs Phase of Flight") + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45))
```

## Figure 04

```{r Fig04 | Max Injury Date, echo=T}
ggplot(FAA, aes(x=Fatal, y=date)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  labs(title="Injuries vs Phase of Flight") + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45))
```
